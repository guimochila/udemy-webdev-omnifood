# Omnifood Website - Fictitious Website

Omnifood website is a fictitious website created in the Udemy web development course I take. <brZ>
I also take a short Gulp training which I added to the project which is now using the following technologies:

  - HTML5
  - CSS3 (Sass expected in the near future)
  - Javascript, JQuery
  - Handlebars
  - Gulp
